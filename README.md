# antTurtle
another look at Langton's Ant using a simple turtle to draw

using a turtle called greg 

his x and y are held in a PVector and his heading is an angle

his new positon is obtained by using polar to cartesian coordinates




antTurtle no rule shows just the basic movment of the turtle

antTurtlePoly shows the ant turtle drawing polygons using different heading angles

antTurtleRule 

has Langton's ant rules 

and has the option of changes the size and setting random points 

or filling the whole screen solid

which in effect creates the inverse of the ant path


some really interesting results with rotating the antTurtle differnt degrees

left 30 right 30 makes a messy oscillation with no highway

let 60 right 60 makes an oscillation with north and south highways

left 60 right 120 makes another oscillation with diverse highways

left 1 right 1 draws circles

right 150 left 30 draws vertical and horizontal highways  but right 30 left 150 doesn't!!!

right 180 left 30 is a really tight oscillation

right 180 left 10 is a makes pretty circles  and reversed does the same

right 6 left 180 is a tight oscillation

right 60 left 150 has pretty fractal loops as hightways!!!
